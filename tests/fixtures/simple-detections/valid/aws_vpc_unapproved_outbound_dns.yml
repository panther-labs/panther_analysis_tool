  MITRE ATT&CK:
    - TA0011:T1071
Severity: Medium
Description: >
  Alerts if outbound DNS traffic is detected to a non-approved DNS server. DNS is often used as a means to exfiltrate data or perform command and control for compromised hosts. All DNS traffic should be routed through internal DNS servers or trusted 3rd parties.
Runbook: >
  Investigate the host sending unapproved DNS activity for signs of compromise or other malicious activity. Update network configurations appropriately to ensure all DNS traffic is routed to approved DNS servers.
